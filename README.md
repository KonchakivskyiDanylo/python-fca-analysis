This project analyzes and compares Python libraries for Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) with a focus on sociological data.
It was developed as part of a collaborative research initiative (KSE Graph Theory Lab) and applies FCA to
multi-year survey datasets to extract patterns, rules, and conceptual structures.

## 🧠 Overview

Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) helps discover hierarchical relationships between objects and attributes in binary data.
This project benchmarks three Python FCA libraries (`fcapy`, `concepts`, `fca-algorithms`) using real sociological
survey datasets (ESS rounds 1–9).

Goals:

- Benchmark FCA libraries on usability, performance, and feature set.
- Extract association rules and concept lattices from survey data.
- Analyze trends across years and track rule stability.

## What is Formal Concept Analysis?

Formal Concept Analysis transforms tabular data into **concept lattices**, revealing relationships between attributes.

### Key Terms:

- **Formal Context**: Binary relation between objects and attributes.
- **Formal Concept**: Pair of objects and their shared attributes.
- **Lattice**: A hierarchy of formal concepts.
- **Implications**: "If A then B" logic rules.

## Library Comparison

| Library            | Concepts | Implications | Stability | Support | Ease of Use | Performance | Documentation |
|--------------------|----------|--------------|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **fcapy**          | ✅ Full   | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐         |
| **concepts**       | ✅ Basic  | ✅ Limited    | ❌ No      | ❌ No    | ⭐⭐⭐         | ⭐⭐          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐          |
| **fca-algorithms** | ✅ Full   | ❌ No         | ❌ No      | ❌ No    | ⭐⭐⭐         | ⭐⭐⭐⭐        | ⭐⭐            |

### Our Recommendation:

* Use `fcapy` for **concept extraction**.
* Use `fca-algorithms` for **implication mining**.

## 📚 Use Cases

* 🧠 **Clustering public opinion** by shared attribute sets
* 📊 **Trend comparison** across ESS survey rounds
* 🛠️ **Survey validation** through rule inconsistency detection
* 🔄 **Demographic cross-tabulation** with FCA-based association rules
