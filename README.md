## About the Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Python libraries for Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) with a focus on
sociological research applications. Developed as part of the KSE Graph Theory Laboratory, it evaluates various FCA
implementations and demonstrates their application to survey data analysis.

The project aims to bridge mathematical graph theory with practical applications in social sciences, providing
researchers with tools to discover hidden patterns and relationships in complex survey datasets.

## What is Formal Concept Analysis?

Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mathematical framework for data analysis and knowledge discovery that reveals
conceptual structures hidden in data. It transforms datasets into concept lattices, showing hierarchical relationships
between objects (e.g., survey respondents) and their attributes (e.g., responses).

### Key Concepts:

- **Formal Context**: A binary relation between objects and attributes
- **Formal Concept**: A pair consisting of objects and their common attributes
- **Concept Lattice**: A hierarchical structure of all concepts in the data
- **Implications**: Logical rules that describe dependencies between attributes (if A then B)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Basic understanding of data analysis concepts
- Familiarity with survey data formats

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KonchakivskyiDanylo/python-fca-analysis.git
   cd python-fca-analysis
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv fca_env
   source fca_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: fca_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Working with Your Own Data

The framework supports various data formats:

- CSV files with survey responses
- Excel spreadsheets
- JSON datasets
- Any tabular data that can be converted to binary format

Simply replace the data loading step with your preferred format and run the analysis pipeline.

### Key Features Comparison:

- **Concepts**: Generation of formal concepts from data
- **Implications**: Discovery of attribute dependencies and rules
- **Stability**: Robustness measures for concepts
- **Support**: Statistical support measures for concepts
- **Ease of Use**: API design and learning curve
- **Performance**: Speed and memory efficiency
- **Documentation**: Quality of docs and examples

## Use Cases

### Sociological Research Applications:

- **Opinion Clustering**: Identify groups of respondents with similar viewpoints
- **Demographic Analysis**: Explore relationships between demographics and responses
- **Survey Validation**: Discover inconsistencies or patterns in survey design
- **Trend Analysis**: Compare survey results across different time periods
- **Cross-tabulation Enhancement**: Move beyond traditional statistical methods

### Example Research Questions:

- Which demographic factors are most strongly associated with specific attitudes?
- What are the underlying conceptual structures in public opinion data?
- How do different survey questions relate to each other conceptually?

## Recommendation

**For sociological research and survey analysis, we recommend using:**

* **`fcapy`** for **concept generation** and **lattice construction**, due to:

    * Multiple supported algorithms for fast and flexible concept computation
    * Seamless integration with `pandas` and other data science tools
    * Well-documented interface with practical examples
    * Solid performance on medium to large datasets

* **`fca-algorithms`** for **implication mining**, as it is the only one among the two that provides built-in support
  for computing **attribute implications**.
