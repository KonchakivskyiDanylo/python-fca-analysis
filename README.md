# Formal Concept Analysis for Sociological Research

## Overview

This project explores the application of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to sociological survey data. Developed as part of
the KSE Graph Theory Laboratory, it aims to provide sociologists with new analytical tools to discover patterns,
relationships, and insights from survey responses that might not be evident through traditional statistical methods.

## What is Formal Concept Analysis?

Formal Concept Analysis is a mathematical method for data analysis, knowledge representation, and information
management. It organizes data into a concept lattice, revealing hierarchical relationships between objects and their
attributes. This approach can uncover hidden patterns and conceptual structures within complex datasets.

## Project Goals

- Provide sociologists with innovative tools to analyze survey data
- Transform complex survey responses into binary format suitable for FCA
- Identify conceptual relationships between respondent groups and their answers
- Visualize the conceptual structures in survey data

## Library Evaluation

We evaluated two main Python libraries for FCA implementation:

- **fcapy**: Offers robust functionality for our specific use case and will be our primary tool
- **concepts**: Has limited applicability for our specific needs

## Project Structure

- Source code for data transformation and analysis
- Utility functions for processing survey data
- Test suite to ensure reliability
- Jupyter notebooks with practical examples and visualizations

## Use Cases

- Identifying clusters of respondents with similar opinion patterns
- Discovering correlations between different survey questions
- Analyzing how demographic factors relate to survey responses
- Extracting meaningful concepts from large-scale surveys

## Future Directions

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced applications of graph theory and formal concept analysis in
sociological research. Future work may include:

- Interactive visualization tools for concept lattices
- Integration with other data analysis methodologies
- Extensions for longitudinal survey analysis
- Domain-specific applications for various types of sociological research
